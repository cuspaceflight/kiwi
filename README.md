Are you fed up with  trajectory solvers that try to do too much for you? But also don't want to write your own from scratch? Well, look no further. Kiwi is a minimalistic, barebones trajectory simulator, that can be used for any purpose from sounding rockets to satellite trajectories.

## Installation
Kiwi can be installed via pip, with the following command:

`pip install git+https://github.com/cuspaceflight/kiwi.git`
